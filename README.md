# AsteroidGame
I learn how to make games using Javascript and the Phaser framework.

This game is made in the image of the classic Atari game "Asteroids". It is intended as an exercise. No copyright infringement is intended.

I created this game using the Phaser framework. https://phaser.io/

I followed this amazing tutorial by Zeke Chan to create the basis for the game. http://www.zekechan.net/asteroids-html5-game-tutorial-1/
